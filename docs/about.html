						<h1 style="text-align: center;">About New View Resort</h1>

						<div class=longlinedivider></div><br>

						<p>New View Resort is a five-star Luxury Resort.
						 It's sole purpose is to provide a high quality, fun, and unique experience for all the customers
						 to enjoy!
						</p>
						
						<h2>Meet the Company!</h2>

						<li><b>Founder and CEO</b> - Zy</li>
						<p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">Zy founded New View Resort on April 24, 2037 after she thought
						 of managing a business; one thing crossed her mind.. It's summer! She then created her own company
						 and invested on her big project which turned out to be the luxurious resort that is now well-known
						 around the Philippines.</p><br>

						<li><b>Head Supervisor</b> - NeKoRoSYS</li>
						<p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">NeKoRoSYS graduated with a degree in Computer Science and Medicine, he made several papers
						 regarding artificial intelligence and how to integrate it with the human mind and body. Because of this,
						 he earned a Nobel Prize and a PhD. After years of research, he then settled down with life and decided to
						 help Zy in managing New View Resort.</p>

						<p>They believe that the world can be a better place one step at a time; so, in order to make it happen,
						 they have been actively participating in charity organizations as philantropists by giving children in need free scolarships and goods such as food and clothes.</p>

						<br>

						<div class=longlinedivider></div>

						<h1 style="text-align: center;">About the Computer Exam</h1>

						<div class=longlinedivider></div><br>

						<p style="text-align: center;">This is the official submission of NeKoRoSYS and Zy for Computer's 3<sup>rd</sup> Quarter Practical Examination.</p><br>

						<li><b>Lead Project Developer</b> - NeKoRoSYS</li>
						<p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">NeKoRoSYS handled the files structure, the HTML, and CSS code for the whole project.</p><br>

						<li><b>Lead Concept Artist</b> - Zy</li>
						<p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">Zy handled the overall layout, look, and feel for the whole project.</p><br>

						<h2>Features</h2>
						
						<li><b>Intuitive and Responsive UI and UX</b></li>
						<p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">The CSS was developed to provide a user-friendly
						 experience along with a few lines of JavaScript sprinkled on top to make the side navigation work as expected!</p><br>
						
						<li><b>Clean and Readable Folder Structure</b></li>
						<p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">This project's source folder was structured in a way to keep
						 things organized and readable. CSS and HTML files are separated, and there is a whole folder dedicated to
						 storing images.</p><br>

						<li><b>Compability and Stability</b></li>
						<p style="text-indent: 50px; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px;">Due to the limited time offered for us to finish this project, we decided that it is best to not rely on third-party libraries to keep the whole project
						 simple and only consist of pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In exchange for stability, we have been bound to some limitations and inconveniences. As much as possible, we also didn't use most latest HTML features and tags to make it compatible to older browsers.</p><br>

						<br>

						<h2>What We Learned</h2>

						<p>We learned that web development requires adequate problem solving skills and basic to intermediate knowledge regarding
						 HTML, CSS, and even JavaScript. NeKoRoSYS and Zy spent a lot of time refactoring old code and designs in order to make the website feel
						 more authentic.</p>
